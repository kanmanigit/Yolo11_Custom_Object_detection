Vehicle License Plate Detection using YOLO11

This repository provides a solution for detecting vehicle license plates in images or videos using a pretrained YOLO11 model, further fine-tuned on a large custom dataset. The project leverages PyTorch as its primary deep learning framework and supports both real-time inference (with a sufficient GPU) and offline batch processing of images or video files.

Overview

Accurate detection of vehicle license plates is vital for applications such as automated parking systems, toll booths, and law enforcement. This project employs YOLO11—a single-stage object detection model—to achieve real-time detection.

Highlights:

Uses PyTorch for flexible and efficient model development.
Includes training scripts for further fine-tuning on your own datasets.
Provides inference scripts for batch processing of images/videos or real-time webcam feeds.
Key Features
